# BFT Benchmark Results
The local BFT studio that I am attending organised a Benchmark Challenge where all studio members are invited to take part in a weightlifting challenge. Members are evaluated on 2 types of lifts - Flat Bench Press and Trap Bar Deadlift. 

I thought it would be interesting to do some data analysis on the results after taking a quick look at the data. It was also a good chance for me to see where I placed amongst the rest to get a rough gauge of my fitness (I am very weak :(). 

After 9 weeks, all members will be tested on the 2 lifts again and be scored by their improvement. To make things more exciting, members are also split into teams led by each coach where prizes will be rewarded to the best team. 

I will update this space 9 weeks later once the final results are out!!
